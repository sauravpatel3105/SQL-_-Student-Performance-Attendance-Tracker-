# 📘 **Student Management SQL Project – README**

## 📌 **Introduction**

The **Student Management SQL Project** is a fully structured **relational database system** designed to simulate a real university environment.
It includes entities such as **Students, Faculty, Departments, Courses, Enrollments, Attendance, and Grades**.

This project demonstrates:

* **Database creation**
* **Data insertion**
* **CRUD operations**
* **Joins & Subqueries**
* **Aggregate functions**
* **Window functions**
* **Constraints & Keys**
* **Advanced SQL analysis**

It is an excellent project for learning and practicing **MySQL**, suitable for academic submissions, portfolio building, or improving SQL expertise.

## 🚀 **How to Run This Project**

### **1️⃣ Install MySQL**

You may use:

* **XAMPP** (phpMyAdmin)
* **MySQL Workbench**
* MySQL Shell / Command Line

### **2️⃣ Create the Database**

Copy and run the following:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE Students_data;
USE Students_data;
```

### **3️⃣ Create All Tables**

Run all `CREATE TABLE` queries sequentially:

* Departments
* Faculty
* Students
* Courses
* Enrollments
* Attendance
* Grades

### **4️⃣ Insert Sample Data**

Copy and run all `INSERT INTO` statements provided.

### **5️⃣ Run the Queries**

All questions (Q1 – Q12) contain SQL queries for:

* CRUD operations
* Joins
* Aggregations
* Subqueries
* Window functions
* Case statements
* Date functions

Run these queries individually in your MySQL editor.

### **6️⃣ Test / Modify the Database**

You can add:

* More students
* More attendance
* More courses
* More grades

To expand your project further.
